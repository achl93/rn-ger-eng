# simple-ger-eng
Followed a tutorial from code.tutsplus.com for creating a simple English to German dictionary app for Android using React Native.
  * Adapted code from the tutorial to reflect the current standard of React Native, as the tutorial was out of date
  * Changed stylesheet to better suit my needs
  * Added a swiper component
